Hello, I'm Ariq and here are some of the projects I've worked on in the field of data analysis:
## ðŸ”¸ Customer Segmentation based on Customer Behaviour
- This project is my final project in Purwadhika Data Science & Machine Learning - Job Connector.
- Dataset source: [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/tasks)
- In this project, we put ourselves as a  part of the Data Scientist Team of Olist, e-commerce in Brazil. We are assigned to help the marketing team to create segmentation of Olist customers based on their behavior and provide marketing recommendations for each segment
- Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Segmentation, K-Means Clustering, and Gaussian Clustering.
- Result: Seven segmentation of customers using RFM Segmentation (best model based on high interpretability and has specific segmentations)

## ðŸ”¸ My Spotify Data Visualization using Tableau
- I got inspired to do this project from [Anne Bode - Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-spotify-data-with-python-tableau-687f2f528cdd)
- Pre-processing the dataset in Jupyter Notebook and visualizing using Tableau.

## ðŸ”¸ Analyze Movie Features Correlation to Revenue of the Movie
- The objective of this project is to find the correlated features to gross or revenue of the movie
- Dataset source: [Kaggle Movie Industry: Four decades of movies](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies)

## ðŸ”¸ Customer Segmentation using RFM and K-Means Clustering
- This project is the development from Purwadhika Final Project by focusing on RFM features and K-Means Clustering algorithm.
- Dataset source: [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/tasks)
- Result: Four segmentation of customers -> Best Customers, Loyal Customers, New Customers, and Lost Customers.
