Hello, I'm Ariq and here are some of the projects I've worked on: 
## ðŸ”¸ Customer Segmentation based on Customer Behaviour
- This project is my final project in Purwadhika Data Science & Machine Learning - Job Connector.
- Dataset source: [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/tasks)
- In this project, we put ourselves as a  part of the Data Scientist Team of Olist, e-commerce in Brazil. We are assigned to help the marketing team to create segmentation of Olist customers based on their behavior and provide marketing recommendations for each segment
- Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Segmentation, K-Means Clustering, and Gaussian Clustering.
- Result: Seven segmentation of customers using RFM Segmentation (best model based on high interpretability and has specific segmentations)
