# Customer Segmentation using RFM and K-Means Clustering
In this project, we put ourselves as a  part of the Data Scientist Team of Olist, e-commerce in Brazil. 
We are assigned to help the marketing team to create segmentation of Olist customers based on their behavior.

## ðŸ”¸ Dataset Source: 
Kaggle [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

## ðŸ”¸ Business Problem: 
Business Problem :
- How to segment the customers at Olist marketplace so we can divide customers based on their shopping behaviour?
- What kind of treatment for each cluster to increase retention rate customer?

## ðŸ”¸ Workflow:
1. Data Merging
2. Data Cleaning and Data Pre-processing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Modeling (K-Means Clustering using RFM)
5. Conclusion
6. Business Recommendation

## ðŸ”¸ Modeling:
In the modelling section, the features we use are Recency, Frequency, and Monetary from customers. These three things can describe the transaction behaviour of a customer. The meaning of RFM itself is:
- Recency: The last time the customer made a purchase
- Frequency: Number of transactions
- Monetary: The spending power of a customer
 
By using the RFM feature, we use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation.

Based on the Elbow Method, we choose 4 clusters.

| New Customers           | Made transactions recently, made only 1 transaction, and had the low total transactions.                  | Welcome e-mail to build the relationship, offer loyalty program/reward points, and discount vouchers (Cross/Up-Selling Strategy) |
| Lost Customers          | Not made a transaction for a long time, made only 1 transaction, and had the lowest total transactions.   |  Regular limited offers, discount vouchers, campaign via e-mail and asking for feedback. (Retention & Reactivate Strategies)
